                        "I have been at WOU for over 6 years.
                        In that time, I have taken many classes, met with many instructors, and worked on many projects.
                        While all have been conducive to my growth as a student, 
                        there are some of particular significance to my mind with regards to how
                        they stretched what I thought I could do or accomplish. The works referenced
                        above are examples of just these sorts of projects."
