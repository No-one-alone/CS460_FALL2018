### Part 1: Attack of the Git

### Part 3: Editing the MVC 5 project and adding features.

At the conclusion of this project, we had these edited or added files.

```


```

We will proceed to cover the use of the files in the project.

### Part 3.1: Landing page ⟶ _Layout.cshmtl component



### Part 3.2 Landing page ⟶ Index.cshtml




### Part 3.3:  View for Converter ⟶ Converter.cshtml




### Part 3.4:  Controller for Converter ⟶ HomeController.cs










### Part 3.5:  View for Color Chooser ⟶ ColorChooser.cshtml





### Part 3.6:  Controller for Color Choooser ⟶ ColorController.cs





### Part 3.7:  CSHTML comments


### Part 3.8: Final Results


This shows how the overall file structure of my homework #4 project was organized in Visual Studio Code which is a quite a bit different compared to the last few homeworks due to the structure and content of an ASP.NET MVC 5 web application created via the Visual Studio IDE.

Next, we have a picture of the mile converter feature pre-merge on the landing page.

And a picture of the the color chooser feature pre-merge on the landing page.

Furthermore, the converter feature can be seen here.

And its operation with the use of a GET request and query string as well.

Also, the color chooser feature can be observed below.

Along with its operation with the use of a POST request.

As we can see, everything has been implemented regarding our ASP.NET MVC 5 web application and can be seen to work both according to the above screenshots and the video demo in the link at the top.

Overall, this was a trying but useful experience in becoming aquainted with creating and utilizing the ASP.NET MVC 5 platform for creating web applications under the Model-View-Controller paradigm with the GET and POST server requests for handling data.
