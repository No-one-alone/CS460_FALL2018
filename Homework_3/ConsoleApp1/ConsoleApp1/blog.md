## Homework 3

For the second homework, we were responsible for learning the Javascript language, the javascript language library - jQuery, the Document Object Model (DOM) for HTML pages, how to create HTML forms, handling events caused by a user, and demonstrating additional git command knowledge. This was clearly intended to use the skills and experience gained from the first homework as our jumping off point and was thereby somewhat less challenging as I now had a foundation that was missing before. Furthermore, we were required to use the new topics in combination with HTML and CSS to create a dynamic webpage that responded to user input and action via use of Javascript and jQuery. Specifically, the user input was to be used as part of a calculation or internal logic, and to have it return results to the user in a manner that altered the webpage upon an event like clicking a button.
