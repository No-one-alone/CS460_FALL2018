## Homework 9

Our final homework was to deploy a complex MVC web application, that we had writtion previously as Homework 8, to the cloud. Specifically, this involved learning how to provision and deploy Homeworks 8's database and main program to the Cloud via Azure. This involved creating an account at [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/), then creating the database remotely on Azure, followed by deploying the homework 8 web app on Azure and using the previously setup database.
