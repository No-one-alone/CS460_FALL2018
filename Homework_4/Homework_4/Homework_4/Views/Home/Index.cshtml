        <h2>Color Chooser</h2>
        <p>
            This is a fun and rather strange color chooser with a form that POST's the data entered by the user to the server.
        </p>

        @* This is the button for the user to click. 
           It is a Razor Html.ActionLink where the first paramenter specifies the text of the button, the second is
            the name of the relevant controller function i.e ColorChooser(), and the third is the name of the folder that contians the Views.*@
        <p><a class="btn btn-primary" @Html.ActionLink("Check it out!", "ColorChooser", "Color")</a></p>
