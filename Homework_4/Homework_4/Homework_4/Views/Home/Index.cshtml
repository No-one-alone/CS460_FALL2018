    <h1>CS 460 Homework 4</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        This assignment demonstrates the implementing of a few forms, some simple server-side logic,
        learning the basics of GET, POST, query strings,
        and form data along with handling all of it via a ASP.NET MVC 5 application.

<div class="row">

    @*This contains a description of what the mile distance converter does and the button that leads to it.*@
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>Mile to Metric Converter</h2>
        <p>
            Ever wonder how many millimeters make up a mile or how large a kilometer is relative to a mile?
            Well wonder no longer! This calculator will answer these questions and more!
            Note that it uses query strings to send form data obtained from user input to the
            server. The server will calculate the answer and return it in the requested page to the user.
        </p>

        @*This specifies the button that links and takes the user to the Converter page via a Razor Html.ActionLink()
           The first parameter gives the name of the button, the second gives the name of a controller function,
            and the third, the name of the folder that contains the file with the appropriate View.*@
        <p><a class="btn btn-primary" @Html.ActionLink("Try it!", "Converter", "Home")</a></p> 

    </div>

   @* This describes the color chooser option and provides a button that links and takes the user to the feature.*@
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>Color Chooser</h2>
        <p>
            This is a fun and rather strange color chooser with a form that POST's the data entered by the user to the server
            and returns the specified colors along with the mixed result to the user.
        

        </p>

        @* This is the button for the user to click. 
           It is a Razor Html.ActionLink where the first paramenter specifies the text of the button, the second is
            the name of the relevant controller function i.e ColorChooser(), and the third is the name of the folder that contians the Views.*@
        <p><a class="btn btn-primary" @Html.ActionLink("Check it out!", "ColorChooser", "Color")</a></p>
