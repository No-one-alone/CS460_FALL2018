## Welcome to my student portfolio

This portfolio is meant to showcase my work from the senior software engineering sequence for my computer science degree.

### About Me

My name is Khorben A. Boyer, and I am a Senior year Computer Science Major at [Western Oregon University](https://www.wou.edu/) in Monmouth, Oregon. Per my current schedule, I am set to graduate in June 2019. My academic journey at WOU has led me to obtain additional majors in Mathematics and Economics prior to my Senior year in CS.
